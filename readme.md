1) ## `divisor()` Instruction
    function that computes the greatest common divisor of two integers, using [Euclidâ€™s algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm). 

2) ## `calculate_cost()` Instruction

    Each car normally costs $10,000 to produce individually, regardless of whether it is successful or not. But with a bit of planning, 10 cars can be produced together for $95,000.

    For example, 37 cars can be produced in the following way: 37 = 3 x groups of ten + 7 individual cars

    So the cost for 37 cars is: 3*95,000+7*10,000=355,000

    Implement the function CalculateCost that calculates the cost of producing a number of cars, regardless of whether they are successful.
