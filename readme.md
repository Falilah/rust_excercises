1) ## `divisor()` Instruction
    function that computes the greatest common divisor of two integers, using [Euclidâ€™s algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm). 

2) ## `calculate_cost()` Instruction

    Each car normally costs $10,000 to produce individually, regardless of whether it is successful or not. But with a bit of planning, 10 cars can be produced together for $95,000.

    For example, 37 cars can be produced in the following way: 37 = 3 x groups of ten + 7 individual cars

    So the cost for 37 cars is: 3*95,000+7*10,000=355,000

    Implement the function CalculateCost that calculates the cost of producing a number of cars, regardless of whether they are successful.

3) ## `prime_factors()` Instruction
    Compute the prime factors of a given natural number.

    A prime number is only evenly divisible by itself and 1.

    Note that 1 is not a prime number.

    Example
    What are the prime factors of 60?

    Our first divisor is 2. 2 goes into 60, leaving 30.
    2 goes into 30, leaving 15.
    2 doesn't go cleanly into 15. So let's move on to our next divisor, 3.
    3 goes cleanly into 15, leaving 5.
    3 does not go cleanly into 5. The next possible factor is 4.
    4 does not go cleanly into 5. The next possible factor is 5.
    5 does go cleanly into 5.
    We're left only with 1, so now, we're done.
    Our successful divisors in that computation represent the list of prime factors of 60: 2, 2, 3, and 5.
